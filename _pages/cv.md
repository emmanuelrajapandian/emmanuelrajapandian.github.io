<p align="justify"> 
I work towards enhancing ASIN conversion rates for Amazon US Stores by building ETL data pipelines and pooling the data through ML, Generative AI tech stack such as LLMs, RAGs to extract insights. I have over 4+ years of dedicated experience in ML/AI, including roles as a Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Engineer/Analyst. Since mid 2023, I have been interested in Causal ML trying to evaluate the cause and effect of business usecases with SOTA models. I have also been exploring LLMs, using advanced prompting technqiues, guardrails to address and help solve customer pain points in WW Amazon Stores. I love to solve problems which improve the customer experience and cherish new and complex challenges. </p>
