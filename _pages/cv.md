<p align="justify"> 
I work towards enhancing ASIN search impressions & conversion rates for Amazon US Stores by building ETL data pipelines and pooling the data through ML, Generative AI tech stack such as LLMs, RAGs to extract insights & build analytical solutions. I have over 4+ years of dedicated experience in ML/AI, including roles as a Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Engineer/Analyst. Since mid 2023, I have been interested in Causal ML trying to evaluate the cause and effect of business usecases with SOTA models. I have also been exploring LLMs, using advanced prompting technqiues, guardrails to address and help solve customer pain points in WW Amazon Stores. I love to solve problems which improve the customer experience and cherish new and complex challenges. </p>
